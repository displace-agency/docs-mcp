# Shopify MCP Setup Documentation

## Overview

This document details multiple attempts to set up a Shopify MCP server for Claude Desktop on August 8, 2025. Despite trying three different implementations, none were fully functional.

## Environment Details

- **Operating System**: macOS (Mac with Apple Silicon)
- **Claude Desktop Version**: Current as of August 8, 2025
- **Node.js**: Available via `/usr/local/bin/node`
- **NPM/NPX**: Available
- **Docker**: Installed and running
- **Store**: [STORE_NAME].myshopify.com

## Implementations Attempted

### 1. best-shopify-mcp (NPM Package)
- **Source**: NPM registry
- **Setup Method**: Both Docker and direct npx
- **Result**: Partially loaded but tools not accessible

### 2. antoineschaller/shopify-mcp-server
- **Source**: https://github.com/antoineschaller/shopify-mcp-server
- **Setup Method**: Git clone, npm install, build
- **Result**: Server loaded, tools visible but not executable

### 3. sudip358/Shopify-MCP-Tools
- **Source**: https://github.com/sudip358/Shopify-MCP-Tools
- **Setup Method**: Git clone, npm install, build
- **Result**: Similar to attempt #2

## Common Issues Observed

1. **Partial Loading**: All implementations showed up in Claude Desktop's MCP server list
2. **Tool Registration**: Tools appeared to be registered (visible in Claude's interface)
3. **Execution Failure**: Tools could not be executed when called
4. **No Error Messages**: Silent failures with no clear error messages in logs

## Root Cause Analysis

The likely causes for the failures:

1. **Protocol Version Mismatch**: The Shopify MCP implementations may be using an older or incompatible version of the MCP protocol
2. **Tool Registration Format**: There may be a mismatch in how tools are registered vs. how Claude Desktop expects to call them
3. **Authentication Flow**: Shopify's OAuth requirements might not be fully compatible with MCP's authentication model
4. **Missing Dependencies**: Some required runtime dependencies might not be properly initialized

## Recommendations

1. **Check MCP Protocol Version**: Ensure compatibility between Claude Desktop's MCP version and the server implementation
2. **Debug Logging**: Enable verbose logging in Claude Desktop to capture more details
3. **Official Support**: Wait for an official Shopify MCP implementation from Anthropic or Shopify
4. **Alternative Approaches**: Use direct API calls or web-based tools instead of MCP for now

## Alternative Solutions

While MCP doesn't work, you can:
1. Use Shopify Admin API directly via HTTP requests
2. Create custom scripts using Shopify's REST or GraphQL APIs
3. Use Shopify's official CLI tools
4. Utilize Shopify's web admin interface
