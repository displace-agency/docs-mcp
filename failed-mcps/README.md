# Failed MCP Implementations

This directory contains documentation for MCP servers that failed to work properly with Claude Desktop.

## Failed Implementations

### 1. [Shopify MCP](./shopify-mcp/)
- **Status**: ‚ùå Failed
- **Attempts**: 3 different implementations
- **Issue**: Server loads but tools not executable
- **Root Cause**: Protocol incompatibility

## Common Failure Patterns

1. **Partial Loading**: Servers appear in Claude Desktop but don't function
2. **Silent Failures**: No error messages or debugging information
3. **Tool Registration Issues**: Tools visible but not callable
4. **Protocol Mismatches**: Incompatibility between server and Claude Desktop

## Lessons from Failures

- Protocol version compatibility is critical
- Silent failures make debugging nearly impossible
- Community implementations may not be production-ready
- Need for official support and standardization

See individual implementation folders for detailed documentation.
